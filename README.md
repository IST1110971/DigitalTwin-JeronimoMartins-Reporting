# 🏭 Digital Twin: Creation of a Digital Twin of a Jerónimo Martins Distribution Center

This repository contains the Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks developed for my Master's thesis:  
**"Digital Twin: Creation of a Digital Twin of a Jerónimo Martins Distribution Center"**,  
carried out in collaboration with **Jerónimo Martins**, owner of Pingo Doce and other retail brands.

The project aims to process, clean, and visualize logistics data from multiple warehouses to identify bottlenecks, detect inefficiencies, and optimize product flows — including both **non-perishable** and **perishable (fresh and frozen)** goods.

## 📘 Abstract

Jerónimo Martins is developing a **digital twin** of one of its distribution centers to improve visibility and efficiency in logistics operations.  
Using **Information Visualization** and **data analytics**, this project extends an existing system for non-perishable goods to also handle fresh and frozen products.  
The result is an integrated dataset that supports optimization and visualization of product flows across different warehouse sections.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.12**
- **pandas** — data manipulation and normalization  
- **NumPy** — numerical computation  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** — visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** — exploration and documentation  
- **OutSystems** — low-code platform used to integrate and visualize results within the digital twin dashboards

## 📓 Jupyter Notebook
The repository includes a Jupyter Notebook named [`JMData.ipynb`](./JMData.ipynb), which documents the complete **data cleaning and normalization process**.  
It provides a step-by-step view of how the datasets were loaded, filtered, transformed, and validated using the **pandas** library. 

This notebook serves as a reproducible record of the preprocessing workflow described in the thesis.
