# üè≠ Digital Twin of a Distribution Center ‚Äî Data Processing and Visualization

This repository contains the Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks developed for my Master's thesis:  
**"Digital Twin of a Distribution Center ‚Äì Data Cleaning, Normalization and Visualization of Product Flows"**,  
carried out in collaboration with **Jer√≥nimo Martins**, owner of Pingo Doce and other retail brands.

The project aims to process, clean, and visualize logistics data from multiple warehouses to identify bottlenecks, detect inefficiencies, and optimize product flows ‚Äî including both **non-perishable** and **perishable (fresh and frozen)** goods.

## üìò Abstract

Jer√≥nimo Martins is developing a **digital twin** of one of its distribution centers to improve visibility and efficiency in logistics operations.  
Using **Information Visualization** and **data analytics**, this project extends an existing system for non-perishable goods to also handle fresh and frozen products.  
The result is an integrated dataset that supports optimization and visualization of product flows across different warehouse sections.

## üß† Technologies Used

- **Python 3.12**
- **pandas** ‚Äî data manipulation and normalization  
- **NumPy** ‚Äî numerical computation  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** ‚Äî visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** ‚Äî exploration and documentation  
- **OutSystems** ‚Äî low-code platform used to integrate and visualize results within the digital twin dashboards

## üìì Jupyter Notebook
The repository includes a Jupyter Notebook named [`JMData.ipynb`](./JMData.ipynb), which documents the complete **data cleaning and normalization process**.  
It provides a step-by-step view of how the datasets were loaded, filtered, transformed, and validated using the **pandas** library. 

This notebook serves as a reproducible record of the preprocessing workflow described in the thesis.
