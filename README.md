# Digital Twin of a Distribution Center ‚Äî Data Processing and Visualization

This repository contains the Python scripts developed for my Master's thesis:
**"Digital Twin of a Distribution Center ‚Äì Data Cleaning, Normalization and Visualization of Product Flows"**,  
carried out in collaboration with **Jer√≥nimo Martins**, owner of Pingo Doce and several other brands.

The main objective of the project is to process, clean, and visualize logistics data from different warehouses in order to identify bottlenecks, detect inefficiencies, and support optimization of product flows ‚Äî including both **non-perishable** and **perishable (fresh and frozen)** goods.

## üìä About the Project

Jer√≥nimo Martins is developing a **digital twin** of one of its distribution centers.  
Using **Information Visualization** and **data analytics**, the system enables real-time observation of product flows and supports predictive analysis to optimize warehouse operations.

This repository extends a previous project that handled non-perishable products, adding support for perishable goods and ensuring normalized data integration across multiple warehouses.
